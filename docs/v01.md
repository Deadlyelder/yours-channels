## Formal Languages

A *word* is a sequence of symbols like *abab* or *aaa*. A *formal language* is a set of words. Examples of formal languages are the set of words of even length, a language consisting only of the three words *{abab, ababab, abcdef}*, or the "addition language" containing all triples *(x,y,z)* such that *z=x+y*.

### Deciding a language

A machine *decides* a language if given a word, it can compute whether that word in the language. Deciding a language requires computation, for example given *(x,y,z)* one has to compute whether x+y=z to determine whether *(x,y,z)* is in the "addition language" described in the above paragraph.

## Formal Languages in Bitcoin script

Let *t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>3</sub>, ...* be a sequence of transactions, each with a single input and a single output. We call such a sequence a *transaction chain* if the output of *t<sub>i</sub>* is spent by the input of *t<sub>i+1</sub>*. We denote the input script of *t<sub>i</sub>* by *in<sub>i</sub>* and it's output script by *out<sub>i</sub>*.

The scripts are evaluated in the following order

in<sub>1</sub> out<sub>0</sub> | in<sub>2</sub> out<sub>1</sub> | in<sub>2</sub> out<sub>1</sub> | in<sub>2</sub> out<sub>1</sub> | ...

The vertical bars "|" illustrate the fact that the stack is cleared after evaluating the output scripts.

### Deciding a language in Bitcoin script

We will say that chain *t<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>3</sub>, ..., t<sub>n</sub>* checks a word *w* iff *t<sub>0</sub>* puts *w* onto the stack and *t<sub>n</sub>* is spendable. We will say that a language is *decidable in bitcoin script* if for every word *w* there is a transaction chain that checks it.



Bitcoin script accepts a language *L* if there is a transaction chain *t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>3</sub>, ..., t<sub>n</sub>* such that t<sub>n</sub> is spendable if and only if

in<sub>1</sub> pushes a word to the stack that belongs to the language

### Accepting the language "even"

To accept the word *aa* we construct the following sequence of transactions:

 * *in<sub>1</sub>*: Push the *aa* onto the "word stack" and "even" onto the "state stack".
 * *out<sub>0</sub>*: Check that *aa* is on the word stack and that "even" is on the state stack

At this point the stacks are reset.

 * *in<sub>2</sub>*: Push the *a* onto the "word stack" and "odd" onto the "state stack".
 * *out<sub>1</sub>*: Check that *a* is on the word stack and that "odd" is on the state stack

At this point the stacks are reset.

 * *in<sub>3</sub>*: Push the nothing onto the "word stack" and "even" onto the "state stack".
 * *out<sub>2</sub>*: Check that the word stack is empty and that "even" is on the state stack. Make this output spendable by the payee.

We need an "outer loop" that scans the blockchain to find a transaction with output *out<sub>0</sub>*. If such a transaction appears, the outer loop pushes transactions *t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>3</sub>* to the blockchain with the scripts above.

The outputs of transactions *t<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>* are spendable only by the payer, while the last transaction is spendable by the payee.

The above construction can be used to build a smart contract as follows:
