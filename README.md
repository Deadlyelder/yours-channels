# fullnode-pc

A Bitcoin micropayment channel hub built in Javascript. Based on our [Javascript implementation of Bitcoin](https://github.com/yoursnetwork/fullnode). 

Check out our  [gentle introduction to the lightning network](https://github.com/yoursnetwork/fullnode-pc/blob/master/docs/gentle-lightning.md). We also have a [prospectus system description](https://github.com/yoursnetwork/fullnode-pc/blob/master/docs/yours_lightning_03.md) that we are keeping more or less in sync with the  [implementation](https://github.com/yoursnetwork/fullnode-pc/blob/master/lib/agent.js).

This is a work in progress and will change all the time.
